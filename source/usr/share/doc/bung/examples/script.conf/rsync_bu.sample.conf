# Sample configuration file for rsync_bu

# The format of this file
#   * Leading and trailing whitespace (spaces and tabs) is discarded.
#   * Lines beginning with #, empty lines and lines containing only
#     whitespace are ignored.
#   * What is left must be of the format "keyword = value".
#     Any amount of whitespace can be present around the =.
#     For example, these are equivalent:
#         "User name = sampan"
#         "User name=sampan" 
#   * Keywords are case-insensitive and internal whitespace is ignored
#     For example, these are equivalent:
#         UserName, User name, username

# Email for report
#   * Optional.  Ignored when running in subsidiary mode.  Default root.
#   * Example
#       Email for report = foo@foo.org

# Log retention
#   * Optional; default 28.
#   * Units: days.
#   * Ignored when in subsidiary mode
#   * Example
#       Log retention = 14

# Organisation name
#   * Required when not in subsidiary mode and not given on command line; no default
#   * May not contain a "/"
#   * Any value here is overriden when command line option -o is used.
#   * Command line option -o is typically used by supervisory scripts.
#   * Example
#       Organisation name = foo.org

# Mount
#   * Optional; may appear several times
#   * Format
#       Mount = <fs_spec> <fs_file> [options=<options>]
#           [ignore_already_mounted] [ignore_files_under_fs_file]
#       where
#           fs_spec is as described in the fstab man page (commonly called the
#               "device" or "special" file).
#           fs_file is as described in the fstab man page (commonly called the
#               mountpoint).
#           options are used with mount's -o option, described on the mount
#               man page.
#           ignore_already_mounted tells bung not to generate a warning
#               when fs_spec is already mounted.
#           ignore_files_under_fs_spec tells bung not to generate a warning
#               when there are files under the fs_file mountpoint.
#   * Examples
#       Mount = //192.168.1.1/foo /mnt/foo options=credentials=/etc/bung/foo.credentials
#       Mount = /dev/foo-usb-hdd /mnt/offsite-foo
#       Mount = /dev/sda6 /mnt/backup
#       Mount = LABEL=backup /mnt/backup
#       Mount = UUID=548ecadb-8507-4c0b-9f03-84e25238d7f1 /mnt/backup
#       Mount = bar:/home /mnt/bar/home

# rsync
#   * Required if there is to be any backup activity; no default
#   * Format is either of:
#       rsync = SRC DEST [backup_dir=dir] [dest_dir_usage_warning=%]
#           [dest_dir_windows] [--exclude-from=FILE] [nocompression]
#           [retention=days[,nowarn]] [retry=count] [--rsh=COMMAND]
#           [--timeout=seconds] [verbose=level]
#       rsync = source_dir dest_dir options=options [dest_dir_usage_warning=%]
#       where
#         SRC and DEST are as explained in the rsync man page.
#         backup-dir is used to override bung's default backup directory.
#             Apart from personal preference, this is useful when the source
#             default directory contains a file or directory in its root with
#             bung's default backup directory name.
#             Further information in the rsync man page, in the backup-dir
#             section.
#             Default "_Changed and deleted files".
#         dest_dir_usage_warning is the % usage of the file system that contains
#             the destination directory that triggers a warning
#             Default 80.
#             Use dest_dir_usage_warning=0 to disable. 
#         dest_dir_windows tells bung to use rsync options suitable (ha!) for
#             writing to a Windows-FAT or NTFS file system.
#             Default is to assume a sane file system.
#         --exclude-from is as explained in the rsync man page except that any FILE
#             that does not contain a / is prefixed with $BUNG_ETC_DIR, default
#             /etc/bung/.
#         nocompression is used to prevent the use of rsync's --compress option
#             when the source or destination is remote.
#             It is useful when the CPU(s) at either end are weak or normally
#             heavily loaded, especially when the network is fast and normally
#             lighly loaded.
#         options sets the rsync options, verbatim.
#             It is useful when bung's default rsysnc options are not suitable.
#             Individual options may not include embedded spaces, tabs or newlines.
#         retention specifies the number of days that rsync backup files are kept.  
#             If retention is not specified, the default retention is 28.  Use
#             retention=0 to disable retention.
#             If retention=0 is used and there is a "_Changed and deleted files"
#             directory in the root of the destination directory, a warning will be
#             generated.  The warning can be disabled by using retention=0,nowarn
#         retry specifies the number of times rsync_bu will retry the rsync
#             command after it times out.
#             Default 2.
#         --rsh is as explained in the rsync man page.
#         --timeout is as explained in the rsync man page except bung defaults to
#             --timeout=600.  Use --timeout=0 to get rsync's default.
#         verbose may set to 0 to 3, being the number of --verbose options to give
#             rsync.
#             Default 1.
#   * Usage notes:
#       * Jobs are run in the order listed.  When an error is detected, any
#         remaining jobs are not run so it is prudent not to list more than a
#         single rsync job in each configuration file.
#       * When --rsh is used and source_dir or dest_dir begin with [USER@]HOST:,
#         HOST is is resolved according to ssh procedure which usually means it
#         is an entry in /root/.ssh/config which normally also names the private
#         key to use.  The corresponding public key must be in the remote host's 
#         /root/.ssh/authorised_keys file and the local /root/.ssh/known_hosts
#         must must have an entry for the remote host.  If it does not, ssh will
#         prompt interactively; if rsync is being run by rsync_bu,
#         rsync_bu will hang if interaction is not completed.
#         When setting up such a job, use the paswordless logon interactively
#         once to add the remote host to the local /root/.ssh/known_hosts.
#       * When retention is given (must be an unsigned integer), and
#         synchronisation would delete changed and deleted files from the
#         destination directory, they are saved under directory
#             _Changed and deleted files/<year>/<month>/<day>@<hour:minute>
#         for example 
#             _Changed and deleted files/2013/Oct/21@14:12
#       * When retention=0 is configured and the destination directory has a 
#         "_Changed and deleted files" subdirectory, a warning is generated and
#         the subdirectory is not removed.  If it is not wanted, it must be
#         removed manually.
#   * Examples
rsync = /var/foo/ /backup/foo --exclude-from=foo.exclude retention=14
rsync = /var/foo/ /backup/foo options="--archive --verbose"

# Shutdown
#   * Optional; default "No"
#   * Format
#         Shutdown = Yes|No
#         When Shutdown is Yes, shutdown -h +5 is run as the script terminates
#   * Example
#       Shutdown = Yes

# Snapshot
#   * Optional; no default; may appear several times
#   * Format
#       Snapshot = <original volume name> <snapshot volume name>
#           <fs_file> [ignore_files_under_fs_file] [size=<size>] 
#       where
#           original volume name is as described in the lvcreate man page under
#               --snapshot.
#               If there is a single volume group, the volume group path may be
#               omitted, for example /dev/vg00/root maybe be given as root.
#           snapshot volume name is the lvcreate man page's VolumeGroup{Name|Path}
#               If there is a single volume group, the volume group path may be
#               omitted, for example /dev/vg00/snap-root maybe be given as
#               snap-root.
#           fs_file is the mountpoint for the snapshot
#           ignore_files_under_fs_file tells bung not to generate a warning
#               when there are files under the fs_file mountpoint.
#           size is the snapshot volume size as described in the lvcreate man page
#               under --size.
#               Commas may be used as thousands separators.
#               Default; same size as the original volume.
#   * Examples
#       Snapshot = /dev/vg0/var /dev/vg0/snap-var /mnt/snap-var size=2G
#       Snapshot = var snap-var /mnt/snap-var size=2048M
