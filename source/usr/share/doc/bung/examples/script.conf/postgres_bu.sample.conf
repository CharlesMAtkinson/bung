# Sample configuration file for postgres_bu

# The format of this file
#   * Leading and trailing whitespace (spaces and tabs) is discarded.
#   * Lines beginning with #, empty lines and lines containing only
#     whitespace are ignored.
#   * What is left must be of the format "keyword = value".
#     Any amount of whitespace can be present around the =.
#     For example, these are equivalent:
#         "User name = sampan"
#         "User name=sampan" 
#   * Keywords are case-insensitive and internal whitespace is ignored
#     For example, these are equivalent:
#         UserName, User name, username

# Format references: man pages bung.common (5) and bung.postgres_bu (5)

# Email for report
#   * Optional.  Ignored when running in subsidiary mode.  Default root.
# Email for report = foo@foo.org

# Log retention
#   * Optional; default 28.
#   * Units: days.
#   * Ignored when in subsidiary mode
# Log retention = 14

# Mount
#   * Optional; may appear several times
#   * Format
#       Mount = <fs_spec> <fs_file> [options=<options>]
#           [ignore_already_mounted] [ignore_files_under_fs_file]
#       where
#           fs_spec is as described in the fstab man page (commonly called the
#               "device" or "special" file).
#           fs_file is as described in the fstab man page (commonly called the
#               mountpoint).
#           options are used with mount's -o option, described on the mount
#               man page.
#           ignore_already_mounted tells bung not to generate a warning
#               when fs_spec is already mounted
#           ignore_files_under_fs_spec tells bung not to generate a warning
#               when there are files under the fs_file mountpoint.
#   * Examples
#       Mount = //192.168.1.1/foo /mnt/foo options=credentials=/etc/bung/foo.credentials
#       Mount = /dev/foo-usb-hdd /mnt/offsite-foo
#       Mount = /dev/sda6 /mnt/backup
#       Mount = LABEL=backup /mnt/backup
#       Mount = UUID=548ecadb-8507-4c0b-9f03-84e25238d7f1 /mnt/backup
#       Mount = bar:/home /mnt/bar/home

# Organisation name
#   * Required when not in subsidiary mode and not given on command line.
#   * May not contain a "/"
#   * Any value here is overriden when command line option -o is used.
#   * Command line option -o is typically used by supervisory scripts.
# Organisation name = foo.org

# PostgreSQL
#   PostgreSQL = [dest_dir=dir] [dest_dir_usage_warning=%]
#       [exclude=db1,db2 ...] [retention=days] [timestamp_format=format]
# Where:
#   * dest_dir: names the directory to create the PostgreSQL backups in.
#       Default /var/backup/postgres
#   * dest_dir_usage_warning is the % dest_dir usage that triggers a warning.
#       Default 80.
#       Use dest_dir_usage_warning=0 to disable. 
#   * exclude: names the databases to exclude.
#       Default: backup all databases except template0 and template1.
#   * retention: is the number of days to keep previous backups.
#       Default 28.
#   * timestamp_format is the date command format used to generate timestamps
#       for use in backup file names.
#       Default %Y-%m-%d@%H:%M:%S
# Examples
#   PostgreSQL =
#   PostgreSQL = dest_dir=/mnt/backup exclude=sandbox,test

# Shutdown
#   * Optional; default "No"
#   * Format is
#         Shutdown = Yes|No
#   * When Shutdown is Yes, the shutdown command is run:
#         shutdown -h +5
# Shutdown = Yes

# Snapshot
#   * Optional; no default.
#   * Format is
#         Snapshot = <original volume name> <snapshot volume name> <mountpoint> [size=<size>] 
#     where
#         - <original volume name> is as described in the lvcreate man page under
#           --snapshot
#           If <original volume name> does not begin with / it is taken as
#           relative to /dev/<volume group name>.  This fails when there is more
#           than one volume group.
#         - <snapshot volume name> is the lvcreate man page's
#            "VolumeGroup{Name|Path}" 
#           If <snapshot volume name> does not begin with / it is taken as
#           relative to /dev/<volume group name>.  This fails when there is more
#           than one volume group.
#         - <mountpoint> is the directory to mount the snapshot on
#         - <size>, if given, is used for the snapshot volume size.
#           Commas may be used as thousands separators.
#           Default; same size as the original volume.
#       * May appear multiple times.
# Snapshot = /dev/vg0/var /dev/vg0/snap-var /mnt/snap-var size=2G
# Snapshot = var snap-var /mnt/snap-var size=2048M
