# Sample configuration file for hotplug_usage_check

# * Leading and trailing whitespace (spaces and tabs) is discarded.
# * Lines beginning with #, empty lines and lines containing only
#   whitespace are ignored.
# * What is left must be of the format "keyword = value".
#   Any amount of whitespace can be present around the =.
#   For example, these are equivalent:
#       "User name = sampan"
#       "User name=sampan" 
# * Keywords are case-insensitive and internal whitespace is ignored
#   For example, these are equivalent:
#       UserName, User name, username

# Check hotplug usage
#   * Required if any checking to be done; may appear several times
#   * Format:
#         Check hotplug usage = Organisation=<organisation name>
#             [Email=<email address>] [MaxBackupAge=<days>]
#             [MaxDeviceChangeDays=<days>]
#             where
#                 organisation name must be enclosed in double quotes (") if it
#                     contains spaces or tabs.  A " can be included in the
#                     organisation name by preceding it with a \
#                 Email=<email address>   Address to send report to when the
#                     organisation's last backup to hotplug storage was too long ago
#                     and when the hotplug storage device was changed too long ago.
#                     Default root.  May be repeated.
#                 MaxBackupAge=<days> is the maximum number of days allowed
#                     since the organisation's last backup before a mail is sent.
#                     Default: 3
#                 MaxDeviceChangeDays=<days> is the maximum number of days allowed
#                     since the hotplug storage device was changed before a mail
#                     is sent.
#                     Default: 3
#   * Example
        Check hotplug usage = Organisation="Al \"Scarface\" Capone" Email=me@foo.org Email=me_too@foo.org MaxBackupAge=2 MaxDeviceChangeDays=8

# Email for report
#   * Optional.  Ignored when running in subsidiary mode.  Default root.
#   * Example
#       Email for report = foo@foo.org

# Log retention
#   * Optional; default 28.
#   * Units: days.
#   * Ignored when in subsidiary mode
#   * Example
#       Log retention = 14

# Organisation name
#   * Required when not in subsidiary mode and not given on command line; no default
#   * May not contain a "/"
#   * Any value here is overriden when command line option -o is used.
#   * Command line option -o is typically used by supervisory scripts.
#   * Example
#       Organisation name = foo.org

# Mount
#   * Optional; may appear several times
#   * Format
#       Mount = <fs_spec> <fs_file> [options=<options>]
#           [ignore_already_mounted] [ignore_files_under_fs_file]
#       where
#           fs_spec is as described in the fstab man page (commonly called the
#               "device" or "special" file).
#           fs_file is as described in the fstab man page (commonly called the
#               mountpoint).
#           options are used with mount's -o option, described on the mount
#               man page.
#           ignore_already_mounted tells bung not to generate a warning
#               when fs_spec is already mounted
#           ignore_files_under_fs_spec tells bung not to generate a warning
#               when there are files under the fs_file mountpoint.
#   * Examples
#       Mount = //192.168.1.1/foo /mnt/foo options=credentials=/etc/bung/foo.credentials
#       Mount = /dev/foo-usb-hdd /mnt/offsite-foo
#       Mount = /dev/sda6 /mnt/backup
#       Mount = LABEL=backup /mnt/backup
#       Mount = UUID=548ecadb-8507-4c0b-9f03-84e25238d7f1 /mnt/backup
#       Mount = bar:/home /mnt/bar/home

# Shutdown
#   * Optional; default "No"
#   * Format
#         Shutdown = Yes|No
#         When Shutdown is Yes, shutdown -h +5 is run as the script terminates
#   * Example
#       Shutdown = Yes

# Snapshot
#   * Optional; no default; may appear several times
#   * Format
#       Snapshot = <original volume name> <snapshot volume name>
#           <fs_file> [ignore_files_under_fs_file] [size=<size>] 
#       where
#           original volume name is as described in the lvcreate man page under
#               --snapshot.
#               If there is a single volume group, the volume group path may be
#               omitted, for example /dev/vg00/root maybe be given as root.
#           snapshot volume name is the lvcreate man page's VolumeGroup{Name|Path}
#               If there is a single volume group, the volume group path may be
#               omitted, for example /dev/vg00/snap-root maybe be given as
#               snap-root.
#           fs_file is the mountpoint for the snapshot
#           ignore_files_under_fs_file tells bung not to generate a warning
#               when there are files under the fs_file mountpoint.
#           size is the snapshot volume size as described in the lvcreate man page
#               under --size.
#               Commas may be used as thousands separators.
#               Default; same size as the original volume.
#   * Examples
#       Snapshot = /dev/vg0/var /dev/vg0/snap-var /mnt/snap-var size=2G
#       Snapshot = var snap-var /mnt/snap-var size=2048M
