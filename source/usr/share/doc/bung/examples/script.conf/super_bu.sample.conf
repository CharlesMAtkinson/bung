# Sample configuration file for super_bu

# * Leading and trailing whitespace (spaces and tabs) is discarded.
# * Lines beginning with #, empty lines and lines containing only
#   whitespace are ignored.
# * What is left must be of the format "keyword = value".
#   Any amount of whitespace can be present around the =.
#   For example, these are equivalent:
#       "User name = sampan"
#       "User name=sampan" 
# * Keywords are case-insensitive and internal whitespace is ignored
#   For example, these are equivalent:
#       UserName, User name, username

# Email for report
#   * Optional.  Ignored when running in subsidiary mode.  Default root.
#   * Example
#       Email for report = foo@foo.org

# Log retention
#   * Optional; default 28.
#   * Units: days.
#   * Ignored when in subsidiary mode
#   * Example
#       Log retention = 14

# Organisation name
#   * Required when not in subsidiary mode and not given on command line; no default
#   * May not contain a "/"
#   * Any value here is overriden when command line option -o is used.
#   * Command line option -o is typically used by supervisory scripts.
#   * Example
#       Organisation name = foo.org

# Mount
#   * Optional; may appear several times
#   * Format
#       Mount = <fs_spec> <fs_file> [options=<options>]
#           [ignore_already_mounted] [ignore_files_under_fs_file]
#       where
#           fs_spec is as described in the fstab man page (commonly called the
#               "device" or "special" file).
#           fs_file is as described in the fstab man page (commonly called the
#               mountpoint).
#           options are used with mount's -o option, described on the mount
#               man page.
#           ignore_already_mounted tells bung not to generate a warning
#               when fs_spec is already mounted
#           usage_warning is the % file system usage that will trigger a
#               warning if it is exceeded when the drive is unmounted.
#               Default: no usage check.
#               Minimum %: 5.
#               Maximum %: 100.
#           ignore_files_under_fs_spec tells bung not to generate a warning
#               when there are files under the fs_file mountpoint.
#   * Examples
#       Mount = //192.168.1.1/foo /mnt/foo options=credentials=/etc/bung/foo.credentials
#       Mount = /dev/foo-usb-hdd /mnt/offsite-foo
#       Mount = /dev/sda6 /mnt/backup
#       Mount = LABEL=backup /mnt/backup
#       Mount = UUID=548ecadb-8507-4c0b-9f03-84e25238d7f1 /mnt/backup
#       Mount = bar:/home /mnt/bar/home usage_warning=75

# Shutdown
#   * Optional; default "No"
#   * Format
#         Shutdown = Yes|No
#         When Shutdown is Yes, shutdown -h +5 is run as the script terminates
#   * Example
#       Shutdown = Yes

# Snapshot
#   * Optional; no default; may appear several times
#   * Format
#       Snapshot = <original volume name> <snapshot volume name>
#           <fs_file> [ignore_files_under_fs_file] [size=<size>] 
#       where
#           original volume name is as described in the lvcreate man page under
#               --snapshot.
#               If there is a single volume group, the volume group path may be
#               omitted, for example /dev/vg00/root maybe be given as root.
#           snapshot volume name is the lvcreate man page's VolumeGroup{Name|Path}
#               If there is a single volume group, the volume group path may be
#               omitted, for example /dev/vg00/snap-root maybe be given as
#               snap-root.
#           fs_file is the mountpoint for the snapshot
#           ignore_files_under_fs_file tells bung not to generate a warning
#               when there are files under the fs_file mountpoint.
#           size is the snapshot volume size as described in the lvcreate man page
#               under --size.
#               Commas may be used as thousands separators.
#               Default; same size as the original volume.
#   * Examples
#       Snapshot = /dev/vg0/var /dev/vg0/snap-var /mnt/snap-var size=2G
#       Snapshot = var snap-var /mnt/snap-var size=2048M

# Subsidiary script
#   * Required for there to be any backup action
#   * May appear multiple times
#   * Format
#       Subsidiary script = <script name> <config file name> 
#           [debug] [nice=<nice>] [ionice=<ionice>]
#       where
#           script name  Is relative to $BUNG_BIN_DIR, default /usr/bin
#           config file name is the configuration file for the script.
#               If it contains no / it is relative to $BUNG_ETC_DIR, default
#               /etc/bung/
#               For a config file in the current working directory, use ./
#           debug enables debug mode in the script
#           nice runs the subsidiary script with the specified nice value.
#               Default is 10.
#               Bigger numbers give lower priority; can keep a personal computer 
#               responsive when running bung backups.
#               Smaller numbers give higher priority; can speed bung backups running
#               on a heavily loaded system.
#               More information on the nice (1) man page.
#           ionice runs the script with the specified ionice values.
#               More information on the ionice (1) man page.
#               Only -c and -n options may be given.
#               If <ionice> contains spaces or tabs it must be enclosed in double
#               quotes.
#   * Examples
#       Subsidiary script = ldap_bu openldap nice=-10
#       Subsidiary script = mysql_bu mysql debug
Subsidiary script = rsync_bu all nice=19 ionice="-c2 -n0"
